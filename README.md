# Pacman-Pathfinder

Implemented search algorithms (such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, A* search) and heuristics for various scenarios of the 
simple Pacman game world (i.e. Food search, Corners problem, etc) and different algorithms (i.e. Minimax algorithm) for a multi-agent 
Pacman game world on the code base provided by the Berkeley University.
